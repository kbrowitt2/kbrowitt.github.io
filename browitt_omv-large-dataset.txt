Karmen BrowittProfessor WisnickiENGL 87721 February 2023      For the pieces that I’ve chosen, I tried to focus on works written by, dictated from, or written about women. A major theme in the full-length works that I tried focusing on was women’s experiences of gender inequality, and I used ChatGPT to help me figure out if the book I was looking at dealt with these themes. For this section I’ve chosen The Chinese Ishmael by Sui Sin Far, Life and Letters of Toru Dutt by Toru Dutt, and The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave by Mary Prince. The pieces written by Toru Dutt and Mary Prince highlight their personal experiences, while the book from Sui Sin Far highlights short stories about fictional people. ChatGPT did identify a few chapters from Sui Sin Far’s book that touch on gender inequality and the cultural expectations of Chinese women who lived in North America. 	The recovered pieces I’ve selected are “Nosutu, the Mother of Soga” by Tiyo Soga, “Gleanings and Glances: The Letter from an African Chief” by NCWADI NKOSI, “Original Correspondence” from Edith Eaton (Sui Sin Far), the proclamation from the Queen of Madagascar titled “The Late Mr. James Cameron of Madagascar,” and the “Letter to A.M. Chirgwin” by Semane Khama. The connections between these pieces are much broader and focuses mostly on if they were written by women or make mention of women in the work.       I took a similar approach with the periodical pieces that I chose: “My Parentage and Early Career as a Slave” by Selim Aga, “Gleanings from Recent Letters. A Conversation with Yoruba Market Women” by Anonymous writers and James White, “Gleanings from Recent Letters. The Gospel Preached by a Captive Yoruba Girl” by Anonymous and Daniel Olubi, and “India. Native Female Education” by Anonymous, Chenjee, Tooloosee, and Lutchmee. Aside from the piece by Selim Aga, the works are written by women and give an insight into women’s experiences. The periodical by Selim Aga mentions his mother and her experience as a slave.Sources: Recovered Texts:Anonymous; John F.
