Description: The following document was created for a University of Nebraska-Lincoln English course titled "Advanced Topics of the Digital Humanities." The assignment asked students to identify a list of 10 works that they would like to work with in their final project. 

      For the pieces that IÕve chosen, I tried to focus on works written by, dictated from, or written about women. A major theme in the full-length works that I tried focusing on was womenÕs experiences of gender inequality, and I used ChatGPT to help me figure out if the book I was looking at dealt with these themes. For this section IÕve chosen The Chinese Ishmael by Sui Sin Far, Life and Letters of Toru Dutt by Toru Dutt, and The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave by Mary Prince. The pieces written by Toru Dutt and Mary Prince highlight their personal experiences, while the book from Sui Sin Far highlights short stories about fictional people. ChatGPT did identify a few chapters from Sui Sin FarÕs book that touch on gender inequality and the cultural expectations of Chinese women who lived in North America. 
	The recovered pieces IÕve selected are ÒNosutu, the Mother of SogaÓ by Tiyo Soga, ÒGleanings and Glances: The Letter from an African ChiefÓ by NCWADI NKOSI, ÒOriginal CorrespondenceÓ from Edith Eaton (Sui Sin Far), the proclamation from the Queen of Madagascar titled ÒThe Late Mr. James Cameron of Madagascar,Ó and the ÒLetter to A.M. ChirgwinÓ by Semane Khama. The connections between these pieces are much broader and focuses mostly on if they were written by women or make mention of women in the work. 
      I took a similar approach with the periodical pieces that I chose: ÒMy Parentage and Early Career as a SlaveÓ by Selim Aga, ÒGleanings from Recent Letters. A Conversation with Yoruba Market WomenÓ by Anonymous writers and James White, ÒGleanings from Recent Letters. The Gospel Preached by a Captive Yoruba GirlÓ by Anonymous and Daniel Olubi, and ÒIndia. Native Female EducationÓ by Anonymous, Chenjee, Tooloosee, and Lutchmee. Aside from the piece by Selim Aga, the works are written by women and give an insight into womenÕs experiences. The periodical by Selim Aga mentions his mother and her experience as a slave.
