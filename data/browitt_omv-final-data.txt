REFINED THEMES
I. Christianity
a. A major theme that flows throughout the works IÕve chosen is the role of Christianity. This theme most connects with the works from my full-length works and recovered pieces sections.  
II. Colonialism
a. This theme is either directly discussed in the works or is working in the background of these works. This theme ties to all of the periodical pieces, one of the recovered pieces, and two of the full-length works. 
III. Experiences of women during colonial times
a. This theme is brought up in each of the book-length works, however, I also see some connection between this and the periodical ÒGleanings from Recent Letters. A Conversation with Yoruba Market Women.Ó 

CRITICAL WORKS
I. On Christianity / Missionary Schools
a. Comstock, Gary Lynn. ÒThe Yoruba and Religious Change.Ó Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 10, no. 1, 1979, pp. 1Ð12. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/1581022. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. This article discusses the Yoruba society and touches on how Christian missionaries tried to convert people from this community. This article is an interesting addition and link directly to two articles, both from ÒGleanings of Recent Letters,Ó that touch on the Yoruba and the Christian missionary efforts of the time. 
b. Copland, Ian. ÒChristianity as an Arm of Empire: The Ambiguous Case of India under the Company, C. 1813-1858.Ó The Historical Journal, vol. 49, no. 4, 2006, pp. 1025Ð54. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4140149. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. This article looks at the complex relationship between Christianity and colonialism in India. This article will give some background information into the book about Toru Dutt and the Gleanings article on education in India, while also giving a glimpse into the relationship between Christianity and colonialism.  
c. Subramaniam, V. ÒConsequencies of Christian Missionary Education.Ó Third World Quarterly, vol. 1, no. 3, 1979, pp. 129Ð31. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/3990283. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. This article looks at the role of missionary schools in India and finds that while these schools had some positive effects (e.g., literacy skills and technical knowledge) overall effect of these schools was largely negative. This article expands the knowledge that users will have when reading the periodical from Gleanings that talks about India native education.   
II. On colonialism
a. Ghosh, Durba. ÒGender and Colonialism: Expansion or Marginalization?Ó The Historical Journal, vol. 47, no. 3, 2004, pp. 737Ð55. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4091763. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. This article discusses the role women played in colonialism as well as discusses other articles that try to look at womenÕs experiences during colonialism. This article ties to the works in the periodical pieces and recovered works.
b. Zambakari, Christopher. "A Discourse on the Legacy of Colonialism for Women in Africa." Africa Policy Journal, vol. 14, 2019, pp. 45-54,X. ProQuest, http://libproxy.unl.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/discourse-on-legacy-colonialism-women-africa/docview/2316721828/se-2.
i. This article examines the gender roles in West Africa during colonial times and places an emphasis on the difference between Western gender roles/expectations and African gender roles/expectations. This article can be applied to the two articles on Yoruba women; however, I think it also raises an interesting point about how the ÒWesternÓ way of looking at something cannot be applied as a universal standard. 
c. Liddle, Joanna, and Rama Joshi. ÒGender and Imperialism in British India.Ó Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 20, no. 43, 1985, pp. WS72Ð78. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4374973. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. Since my project focuses on womenÕs voices during colonial times, this article provides an interesting perspective into how women from India challenged men during imperial times. It looks at different women movements that have happened in India.  
III. On experiences of women
a. Denzer, LaRay. ÒYoruba Women: A Historiographical Study.Ó The International Journal of African Historical Studies, vol. 27, no. 1, 1994, pp. 1Ð39. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/220968. Accessed 8 Mar. 2023.
i. This article discusses the history and role of Yoruba women in their society. This article will provide users interesting insight into the two articles about the Yoruba women, while also giving a bit of insight into the effects of Christianity and colonialism on the Yoruba society.

i. This article ties together three books that discuss the experience of women in China, colonial and postcolonial India, and Africa, respectively. This article (while it summarizes and partially critiques the books) will provide users with further background context into all of the works IÕve chosen. 
c. Davies, Carole Boyce. ÒGender/Class Intersections and African WomenÕs Rights.Ó Meridians, vol. 13, no. 1, 2015, pp. 1Ð25. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2979/meridians.13.1.1. Accessed 9 Mar. 2023.
